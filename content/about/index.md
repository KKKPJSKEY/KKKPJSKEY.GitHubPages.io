[:(fas fa-laptop-code fa-fw): CodeIT](https://github.com/sunt-programator/CodeIT) is a **clean**, **elegant** but **advanced** blog theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) by [Victor Pogor](https://github.com/victor-pogor).

It is based on the original [LoveIt](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt), [LeaveIt](https://github.com/liuzc/LeaveIt) and [KeepIt](https://github.com/Fastbyte01/KeepIt) themes.

See the theme's [demo site](https://codeit.suntprogramator.dev/) for details.
